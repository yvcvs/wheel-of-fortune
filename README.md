# Welcome to my first Python Project: Wheel of Fortune

Over the past two weeks, I've been learning about the basics of Python and doing small exercises to demonstrate my knowledge. This project is the culmination of everything I've practiced.

The game, for this assignment, was altered to be three rounds total: two rounds of "basic" gameplay and one final round with RSTLNE displayed in the puzzle.

## Concepts Learned

- Variables
- Data Types
- String Manipulation
- Flow Control
- Collections
- Functions
- File I/O

## Organization
I started by studying the show and creating a flowchart of gameplay. I established variables to make the game smoother and facilitate storage of needed integers and strings(banks, lists of players, etc.)

Using the flowchart, I determined that some aspects of the game could be defined as functions.

After creating rudimentary functions, I worked on the actual gameplay. I separated this into two sections based on how the rounds operated: groups one and two together with round three on its own.

## Files & Installation

### Files Used
- Code.py (game code)
- segments.txt (parts of the wheel)
- words_alpha.txt (word list for puzzles)
- README.md (this file)
- PseudoCode.py (notes for rearanging code)
- WheelFlowchart.pdf (beginning chart to track game flow)

### Installation
In order to operate the game, download 'Code.py', 'segments.txt', and 'words_alpha.txt'. Make sure they are in the same location so that you can open and read the two text files in the game.

## Further Exploration

Overall I'm happy with how this project turned out. This was my first time using Python in a larger project, so there is definitely room for improvement. I'll be learning Object-Oriented Programming next, so I hope to take some of that knowledge and update this project.

I want to learn more about and get more comfortable with While Loops and overall Python organization. This was my first official project and I had to wade my way through with little knowledge. I eventually found solutions, though they are not as elegant as I'd like them to be. I hope to work on branches of this in my free time to clean it up.

If you have any suggestions, please comment!
